# My_first_project-cloud-height-predict
My first project with Github and Python.

The goal of this project.

I try to use Convolutional Neural Network, with Keras API, to perform regression, to see if I can create a device, with a CNN model, that can estimate the height of clouds.

Hardware used in this project.

Hardware part includes a Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB, a portable charger, and a Infrared 680(pass) filter.

Software of this project.

The platform of the software is Linux-based OS, Raspien. Functions were written in Python.


More about model1:

It is a naive attempt. I tried using a simple CNN regression to predict the heights of clouds.

As one can check the result in the Jupyter file, a simple CNN has the ability to learn the cloud patterns and linked them to cloud height.

This model serves as a base line, some ideas proposed will be tested in model 2 ~ model 4.
