# My_first_project-cloud-height-predict
My first project with Github and Python.

The goal of this project.

I try to use Convolutional Neural Network, with Keras API, to perform regression, to see if I can create a device, with a CNN model, that can estimate the height of clouds.

Hardware used in this project.

Hardware part includes a Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB, a portable charger, and a Infrared 680(pass) filter.

Software of this project.

The platform of the software is Linux-based OS, Raspien. Functions were written in Python.


More about model2:

Model 2 uses a SVM classifier to predict if a image is region of interest(ROI).

Afterward, I put those images predicted as ROI into a regression CNN model.

However, the performence of the model was not good enough. Some intuitive guess were written in the Jupyter notebook file.

As a result of poor performence, the develop of this structure was teminated.
