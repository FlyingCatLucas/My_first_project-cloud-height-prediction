More about model2:

Model 2 uses a SVM classifier to predict if a image is region of interest(ROI).

Afterward, I put those images predicted as ROI into a regression CNN model.

However, the performence of the model was not good enough. Some intuitive guess were written in the Jupyter notebook file.

As a result of poor performence, the develop of this structure was teminated.
